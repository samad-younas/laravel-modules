Objective => This branch is doing Blog crud.All the routes,models and controller and databse functionality is integrated.

Dependency=> This branch is dependent on two more branches. 1) category-crud , 2) Authentication.

........Note start......

The reason of dependency is ,the blog crud is demanding category and authentication functionality,
For example:what if we want to assign category to blog?
what if we want to add user id to that blog which is associated to loggedin user.
So,These two functionalities can't acheive from this branch only,
Thats why we have to merge above mentioned branches first.

.......Note end.........

How to use => 1) Go to main branch, 2) Open terminal and run these commands "git merge blog-crud && git merge category-crud && git merge Authentication" ,3) that's it,Now all the category-crud and Authentication branch code is merge to your project,Use it whereever you want,Good luck!
